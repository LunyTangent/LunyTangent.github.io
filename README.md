# Basic Info
---
A custom 7 Days to Die server? Again? Yes. We've got some good additions this year, I promise.

This time around we are encouraging players to branch out a bit with a leaderboard system! At the end of the event, players with the highest counts or most votes in cases of subjectivity will be earn a place for their username on the LunyTangent leaderboard site (comming soon) Reminder for myself to add a catagories section.


February 27th at 10pm is the Event Night, where anyone and everyone is invited to hop in, merc zombies and each other! PvP is encouraged. To facilitate schedules for different players, and to allow anyone that cannot participate in the Main Event night a chance to place on the leaderboard, the server will run for a week from February 20th to the night of the 27th.


# What's New
---
Mods. We've added several. All are server only, so no need to download anything. Just jump right in!
(insert list of mods, explaining what they do with links to to their download pages)
As well as some custom trader edits I made myself.
1. Traders deal exclusivly in 9mm ammo now. No more Dukes.
2. Most items are sold at any Trader tier now. You might get a really powerful gun or something on day 1 now.
