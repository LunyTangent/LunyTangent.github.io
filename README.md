Welcome! You probably came here for the [events page](lunytangent.com/events) I bet. There is nothing else here after all.

If you're still reading though I have an update about plans for the site. Right now this entire website is just a placeholder and I fully intend to migrate to a platform where I have a lot more control, and where I can work on my web design skills. This site, and future iterations will not have ads. At worst I'll maybe add a link to something like patreon or whatever if hosting costs get out of hand for me. But my content on lunytangent.com will always be free. It's a matter of principle.


However, none of that will happen until I'm done playing Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth at the earliest.
